This is a module to make specifics OCRs at food products and nutricional tables.


As a prerequisite of this project, we have the tesseract library which can be found in more detail at

https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract

# Installation of prerequisites
## Tesseract OCR
The installation of tesseract on the **Linux** system can be done in a few commands:

```bash
$ sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
$ sudo apt install libtesseract-dev
```

And the same goes for **macOS**. There is a variation between MacPorts and Homebrew, but in this post I will only quote the version of Homebrew:
```
$ brew install tesseract
```
After performing the tesseract installation, it is possible to perform OCR in just one command, thus already extracting some words from the image.
> The default language is English, depending on the text, it will not be possible to capture the word/phrase.
If you want to work with another language, you need to make some additional installations. (https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki#other-languages)

## OpenCV
The installation of OpenCV on the **Linux** system can be done in a command:

```bash
$ sudo apt install python3-opencv
```
